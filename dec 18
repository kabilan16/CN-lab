1. 	initiate a wireshark capture and generate  http traffic, create a dsiplay filter to only show packets sent 
	and received between the workstation and the server,observe and note the information 
	about the first TCP SYN packet,window size,http version,IP address of server,status code, last modified HTML and 
	no of bytes returned to the browser.
	
	TCP SYN packet: TCP	66	64046 â†’ 80 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=64240 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM=1
	window size: 64240
	http version: HTTP/1.1
	IP address of server: 42.106.163.11
	status code: 200 OK
	last modified HTML: Sat, 18 Dec 2021 08:06:40 GMT
	no of bytes returned to the browser: TCP Payload 248 bytes
	
2.	Create a simulation scenario in a topology consisting of 3 nodes A,B,C with UDP links. Consider the bandwith of the
	link between A and C as 1Mbps, B and C as 2Mbps. Node A is generating a CBR traffic and Node B with FTP traffic.
	Initiate CBR at t=0.5s and FTP at t=1s. Run the simulation upto 5 seconds. Compare the drop of droptail and red.

	Read the following values for each time period of 0.5s
	A: throughput 
	B: packetdrop 
	C: average packets in Q 
	D: average time of packet in Q
	Show the trace and graph outputs and note the analysis of the same.
