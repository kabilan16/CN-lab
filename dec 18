1. 	initiate a wireshark capture and generate  http traffic, create a dsiplay filter to only show packets sent 
	and received between the workstation and the server,observe and note the information 
	about the first TCP SYN packet,window size,http version,IP address of server,status code, last modified HTML and 
	no of bytes returned to the browser.
	
2.	Create a simulation scenario in a topology consisting of 3 nodes A,B,C with UDP links. Consider the bandwith of the
	link between A and C as 1Mbps, B and C as 2Mbps. Node A is generating a CBR traffic and Node B with FTP traffic.
	Initiate CBR at t=0.5s and FTP at t=1s. Run the simulation upto 5 seconds. Compare the drop of droptail and red.

	Read the following values for each time period of 0.5s
	A: throughput 
	B: packetdrop 
	C: average packets in Q 
	D: average time of packet in Q
	Show the trace and graph outputs and note the analysis of the same.
